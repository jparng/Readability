# Readability
Uses an algorithm to measure the grade level of the text that the user inputs.

Depending on the text that the user inputs, the program will calculate the number of sentences, words, and letters to be used in an algorithm to output the grade that the text would be read at from before 1st grade to above 16th grade.
